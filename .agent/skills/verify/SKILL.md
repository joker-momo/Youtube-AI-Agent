# /supergraph:verify

Fresh verification gate before completion claims.

**Iron Law:** `NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE`

## When to Use

Before saying/implying: done, fixed, passing, clean, ready, complete, works, verified, successful.
Also: before marking `Status: completed`, committing, PR'ing, accepting agent reports, moving to next phase.

## Usage

`/supergraph:verify` | `tests` | `lint` | `build` | `plan auth-login task 2` | `claim "login fixed"`

## Evidence Mapping

| Claim | Required fresh evidence |
|---|---|
| Tests pass | `$TEST_CMD` exits 0, zero failures |
| Lint clean | `$LINT_CMD` exits 0, zero errors |
| Build succeeds | `$BUILD_CMD` exits 0 |
| Bug fixed | Original failing symptom/test now passes |
| Regression covered | RED failed before fix, GREEN passes after |
| TDD complete | RED failure valid, GREEN passes, refactor verified |
| Task completed | Acceptance criteria met + verification commands pass |
| Agent completed | Diff inspected + independent tests/lint |
| Review passed | Reviewer + graph review + tests/lint pass |
| Ready to merge | Tests + lint + build + review PASS |

## Steps

### 0. Announce
"✅ /supergraph:verify — verifying [claim] with fresh evidence..."

### 1. Identify Claim
Map claim to required proofs from evidence mapping.

### 2. Select Plan Context (if applicable)
0 plans → skip | 1 → use | >1 → ask | `plan <slug>` → match.

### 3. Get Commands
Read from plan `## Environment Context` or `.supergraph-env` (set by `/supergraph:scan`). Missing → STOP, run scan first.
No command can prove claim → STOP: "Required check is unknown."

### 3b. Serena diagnostic sweep (optional — highest value step)
For each file touched by the current claim:
```
mcp__serena__get_diagnostics_for_file(file=<file>)
```
If type errors found → STOP verification, report as FAIL before running test suite.
This is the last line of defense — catches LSP-level errors that lint and tests may not surface.
Skip gracefully if Serena unavailable or `SERENA_ACTIVE=false` in `.supergraph-env`.

### 4. Run Fresh Verification (NOW — no reuse of old output)
For agent output: `git diff --stat && git diff --name-only`.
Then run relevant tests/lint/build locally.

### 5. Read Output
Check: exit code, failure count, error count, warnings. Don't confuse lint ≠ build, targeted ≠ suite.

### 6. Report Evidence

**Pass:**
```markdown
## Verification Evidence
- Claim: [claim] | Command: `[command]` → exit 0 → PASS
- Evidence: [output summary] | Timestamp: [now]
```

**Fail:**
```markdown
## Verification Failed
- Claim: [claim] | Command: `[command]` → exit [N] → FAIL
- Failure: [summary] | Next: /supergraph:fix
```

Cannot verify → say so explicitly. No completion language.

### 7. Update Plan Status
Only after evidence passes: `in_progress` → `completed`.
If failed → keep status or mark `stuck` if retries exhausted.

**For user-facing confirmation:** Announce task/plan completion in the user's language.
If plan context exists, show: "Task N completed — [user-facing summary]"

### 8. Report
```
✅ /supergraph:verify complete
- Claim: [claim] | Evidence: [command] → PASS|FAIL
- Next: [recommendation]
```

## Anti-Patterns — Block These
- "should work" / "seems fixed" / "probably passes" / "looks good"
- Trusting agent reports without independent check
- Stale command output | No acceptance criteria check
- Commit/PR without fresh tests+lint+build+review evidence
- Hiding skipped checks behind positive wording

## Evidence Rules
Evidence before claims, always. Fresh only — old runs don't count.
Read output before reporting. No positive language without proof.
Agent output requires independent verification.
